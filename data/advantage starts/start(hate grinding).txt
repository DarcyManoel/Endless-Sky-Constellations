	name "I Hate Grinding"
	description `You grew up on New Boston, an uninteresting world in the Dirt Belt. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of fifteen. After many long years of working at a textile mill, you've finally saved enough credits to apply for a pilot's license from the Republic.`
	description `	This start is identical to the default start, however all systems and wormholes are revealed immediately. You also get a lot of money.`
