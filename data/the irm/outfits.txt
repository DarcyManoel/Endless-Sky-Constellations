	description "The geometry and subsequent workings of this technology seem incomprehensible to any user. However, surprisingly, it proves more than a match for any set of engines of a similar size, especially any that allows for fully-fledged maneuverability. Tekina engines boast a very conservative drain on a ship's resources, far outshining the efficiency of many engines available in this size."
