He notices as you take your seat opposite him and throws you one of his smirks that show you he's up to something.

			`	"I'm sure, such dangerous work has its losses, real losses. I prefer the safety that life within civilized borders affords me, nevertheless, there's something admirable about the path you've carved for yourself."

			`	Somewhat retreated, he hesitates before continuing, "Captain, I see you as a business partner, not for your direct involvement in how business is run, but for the value you offer us when we need you. The prestige you've built around your name during your travels is the talk of the moment, simply put, our affiliation with you alone is a PR boost that justifies your daily stipend." There was an air of discomfort as he began but he quickly returned to his usual confidence as he seemed to find the words, "I don't have time for much of the noise of personal life, the business all but consumes me, though I somehow always catch an ear of the rumors that follow you. Is it true that you've seen beyond Human and Hai territories?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes. There is a lot to discover beyond our reach."`
				`	"Our galaxy isn't so small, there was bound to be more out there."`

They fought with the Quarg long ago and their technology is far beyond our own. There might be an opportunity to import some of their technology under the name of the business." He ponders on that but looks discouraged as he says, "The regulations on that would be a bureaucratic nightmare. The South also brings too much unpredictability, the civil war wasn't too long ago after all. Is there anything else?"`

			`	"North of the Hai there is a species of bird-like nomads, who travel through wormholes to repair broken worlds. Is terraforming a viable business to pursue?" He hesitates momentarily.  "That's a curious path to take, and a lot to take in. Terraforming isn't a direction I'm particularly interested in, we also don't have the scale for that level of investment. What else can you tell me?"`
			`	"Well the Unfettered Hai found a way to invade the nomads in the north, the Wanderers. The Wanderers are fighting a war but only so that they have time to retreat through a wormhole that's opened in their territory, unfortunately, they retreated to a much more dangerous place." Dumbfounded as he is, he finds the words to say, "There truly is a whole live galaxy out there, it's hard to imagine any of this from within the confines of our space."`
			label "korath"
			`	You fall into the conversation in clear neglect of each of your meals, and you start to explain about the Korath, "Beyond Hai space towards the galactic core there are two warring factions of automated warships. They're still stuck in their original programming to construct more of their drones until they wipe the other out, but they also indiscriminately open fire on any foreign ship."`
			`	"This only reinforces my desire to stay in the safety of our territories then, what opportunity would that war afford us anyway?" he casually inserts with a chuckle between breaths. After a moment you start to continue what you were saying, "There's a trove of salvage out there in even their most fringe systems. The scrap and technology you could recover could be invaluable to your interests." He seems none too amused with the suggestion, before beginning a short tangent on the logistics of preparing for the danger in that region. Not even accounting for the risk it presents to the lives of whoever is sent there to protect the operation. He asks you, "Think bigger picture! How can we reinvent the business and put ourselves on the map?"`
			label "arx"
			choice
				`	"Have you thought about relocating the business into unoccupied space?"`
			`	He perks up almost comically as he hears the suggestion, you sit unsure if his response is positive or negative. "<first>, that's brilliant! I planned to operate from an orbital station when I first came into money, the capital needed was still magnitudes more than what was available to me but now, it's a clear next step! We have the infrastructure on the ground already to ensure our funding."`
			`	It's difficult to find a juncture into the conversation, but you decide against it on second thought, doubtful that he would notice you talking back. His mouth is running so fast you almost expect him to lose the words.`
			`	"Captain, I must know what you had in mind!"`
			`	Launching right into it, you go into detail about your recent discoveries; the sight of the fantastical ringworld and the planet seemingly only real in part, while somehow hidden to others.`
			`	As the night goes on it becomes clear that David already has plans that he's ruminating on. There's no telling the breadth of his shelved station project, having just learned that he's had such ambitions. It comes time to call it a night and yourself both end up leaving behind unfinished meals, you shake hands, and he thanks you for your input before you part ways. As you two start to depart, however, David turns to say, "Oh <first>! I almost forgot this wasn't only a social call, I'll be in touch when I can set aside time for a venture. I'm looking forward to breaking ground on this with you."`

			`You descend towards the ringworld, unsure of the nature of David's summons. As the surface begins to come into view, you make out a collection of ships, all of Human design, closely parked together to act as a makeshift site of operations.`
			`	A communication from David is received, and he instructs you on where to land and which ship is his. After which he asks you to meet him on board his ship so that he can appraise you of the state of operations.`
			`	You find David's ship in the collection, walk up the landing ramp, and find him waiting for you within the entrance. Luckily you won't find yourself in the awkward position of divining the directions around this ship, rather, you are led straight to a room that is very well-lit and filled with a handful of David's people. David quickly gets to business as he's still walking in, "The fortunate timing of Captain <last>'s arrival will kick off this meeting. All of this will only have been possible because of their discovery so please, treat the captain as though they are paying half your salary." His opener is met with a quick applause and some laughter at the quip. The response could well be out of obligation rather than being a genuine reaction to your significance, but it doesn't much matter either way.`
			`	"Many of you already know what we're doing here and the progress of affairs, but we'll take it from the top for the sake of Captain <last>." A short pause follows as David prepares his report, while your focus diverts to scanning the room. A tight group of seven people including David and yourself fill the room, and a compact console sits center-of-room. "After receiving the devices that allow ships to access this structure and preparing for expedition, we set down on the ring and began coordinating exploratory teams to geographically map the immediate area. As far as we have found, the surface is a convincing replication of a typical temperate world, or so I'm told by my chief advisors; Cassipeau, and Lyra." he extends an indicating hand towards two women standing closer to the console than the rest. The group has so far seemed thoroughly unimpressed by the summation of events, right until one of the two women interrupts, "Of course, there are large ventilation pits scattered across the terrain, that's not typical."`
			`	"Thank you Lyra, yes, there are large pits and we are unsure of what they are for. I think-", David again gets cut off by someone from the group, all heads turn to one man, "Whatever they are, we have no reason to make them our primary focus over geographical mapping." A short and almost uncivil exchange follows between David, Lyra, and the man.`
			`	David soon after reins in the discussion, almost brashly. "At this moment, our next move is a coordinated descent into one of these anomolies, since fortunately, they're large enough even to fit a ship by far."`
			choice
				`	"Is that where I come in then?"`
			`	David seems amused at the idea, and smirking without even turning to face you, "Goodness no, there is a team set to arrive shortly with a ship for that purpose. They set off shortly before you arrived and shouldn't be getting back here for at least a few days yet."`
			choice
				`	"'At least'? That doesn't sound very confident."`
				`	"So where do I come in?"`
					goto "skip questions"
			`	This time he turns to face you, "Yes, 'at least'. I wasn't aware of how long it would take for you to arrive, so I contacted you before that initiative was begun."`

			`	"I wanted you here to be made aware of our current plans," The others in the room shuffle out through a door opposite the side you entered from.`
			`	"I'm sorry, it must have slipped my mind to make introductions for the others, they're some key advisors I've got on the payroll for the foreseeable future, that actually pales compared to the legal retainers for confidentiality agreements, of course the method by which to gain access is kept a close secret still." A chuckle comes from David and shows transparently how anxious he is already. "We have the unique claim to this marvel with no apparent owner or custodian. I, of course, want to jump on this opportunity before we might lose it."`
			choice
				`	"What are you planning to do here?"`
				`	"How do you expect to not be found out?"`

			`	"I have ambitions now to form a base of operations in this system, to bring the company into new heights of unimpeded progress. It's not necessarily about the money we make but we can make something real here, of course with a tidy profit to keep things on track but that's how things get done." His demeanor is no more serious than before but there is a certain gravity behind his words, this may also be your opportunity to build something for yourself and not operate only to navigate other people's messes.`
			`	You ask David a question that is integral to the outcome of his plans. "How do you expect to keep this secret from the Hai, or humanity, or even the Quarg?"`

Some meats are thinly cut, spread across the serving table, while some mounds look more like imposing slabs of near-black grumble.`

You walk up and prepare to garner her attention, when she turns from her faced-away direction and walks right into you. Bouncing back onto her arms as she falls, she drops a discreetly sized tablet from her hands, "Shoot! I'm awful, I've my head buried in the work I've got myself in."

As everything she was trying so hard to remember strikes her in one moment, she back-tracks and apologizes again for the collision, motioning in some self-deprecation of her intelligence.`
			`	"My head is somewhere, what's going on captain from the briefing?" she says with a grin. Your chance to interject is quickly interrupted by her picking up her tablet and yourself cut yourself off at the cusp of speaking. Her full attention returns to you as she stands back up.`

			`	You squat down to pick up her tablet from the naturally soft surface of the plant-covered plateau. She takes the tablet from your hands, thanking you, "You're very nice, new boss from the briefing. See, I'm sure you thought I wouldn't recognize you."`

Trying to stay busy, good thing is that it's hard to fall short of work on an alien 'world' like this." She quotes with her fingers as she speaks, drawing intentional ambiguity to however to describe this place.`
			`	You cautiously make a quip, "You must be looking in the wrong places, the crew all seem to find time to enjoy themselves." She softly responds, "I'm not them, thankfully. They can enjoy their moment sitting on idle hands, not my thing."`
			`	The two of you finish your chat shortly after sharing your respective reactions when traveling here for the first time.

The scale of devastation is far-reaching as the land shifts and cracks to reclaim the landscape. Even in the face of these most destructive natural forces, remnants of cities remain.`
			`	Gargantuan rows of tracks coalesce and descend underground to shoot past bodies of water, arising in another nearby city. The infrastructure of these cities seems to rely on these tracks more than any alternative in view. Every direction out from the cities is marked by the expanse of tracks, either connecting together for a tighter footprint for distanced travel, or a futher extension of these cities in wide sets. In larger cities it is apparent that while the former inhabitants built large and far, they respected the geography of their planet. Great lakes and mountains have been built around and not over, surely much to the pain of their planners.`
			`	Reminiscent of the ancestral Earth and it's many imitations, much of the skyline digs into the clouds and leaves other buildings in shadow.

The damage to the infrastructure is obvious as great lengths of track are spotted by arches and crooks, which have made them clearly unsuitable to use anymore..`

Trees present in unnatural contortions but being now unconstrained by those that would curate their stature, they grew past their impedances with great fervour.

Deciding to land near the Shield Beetle, you still maintain some distance from it but it's only a short walk.`

Soon, only you and David remain as the rest board the ship, and he remarks on your fortunate arrival yet again. "<first>! You must have a sense for these things. I'm glad you are here for this because we are soon ready to probe the pit." He walks off, expecting you to follow and yourself do, to the same room you were given a briefing in just days earlier.`

We also don't know why this ring is abandoned, or why the planet fell to ruin. Of course, we could run out of funding and have to return to civilization in a worse position than we started." Falling out of his tirade, David turns to face you and acts as if stumbling onto back into reality, "The immediate concern is our limited fuel reserves, we need to establish a convoy for that and a real base of operations to stabilize that situation. That's why all our ships are grounded right now unless they're needed out in the field."`

Without delay, diffused lights shine from the corners of the room, following the lights comes another -ping- but much louder than before. "Ready to move on, Precept, we are at the vent." Soft chuckles are heard in the background before the transmission cuts, and David briefly cracks a grin.`
			`	"Let's get on with it Echelon, descend at will when in position."`
			`	"Received and confirmed, Precept."`
			`	A short delay keeps you both waiting, feeling like minutes go by before anything is relayed back to you two.`
			`	"And we have- not a vent." Almost rhythmically pronounced, "The pit extends much further than anticipated, almost immediately opening up into a coned space. It's a large hangar that I dare say was built as a docking area for ships. Not sure how to explain the look of this place. It's distinctly alien of course but it's not-- it's much different than Hai or Quarg architecture, there are fluid like curves along the walls and supports. You should come and see this David, the precaution was thankfully unnecessary."`
			`	David leaves a few instructions with them such as securing the area, and being sure to relay back scans to update the map. You follow David who briskly walks out of the room and suggests that you both take your ship to investigate.`
			choice
				`	(Depart for the marked entrance.)`
			`	It's not long before you reach the entrance to the hanger. The opening is fortunately much wider than you expected, more than enough to fit your ship through.`
			`	As you descend into the hanger, you're inclined to think of it as a cavern by the large open spaces within. No description would have done this justice over the comms. "This looks.. promising. Every opening like this one on the surface must be an entrance." says David. David is right, the hanger stretches beyond a distance that you can discern, unsure if you can even still imagine the curvature of the ring.`
			`	The first team had already parked their ship down, landing ramp out and extended, floodlights shining against the coarse but rigid foundations. "David, captain, the immediate area is safe, but this isn't just some comically large room. By the limited attempts we've made since we secured the area, we've not come across any end to the space, I might presume that this is expansive of the entire ring." David thanks the team leader and turns to you, "This will take some time to move forward. You're welcome to check in, but I recommend you leave me to handle this stage. I'm sure you have things to do back at civilization anyway."`
