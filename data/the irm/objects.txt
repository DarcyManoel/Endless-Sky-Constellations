planet "Arx"
	government "Uninhabited"
	attributes "requires: quantum keystone" "requires: resonant drain"
	landscape "landscape/the irm/ringworld"
	description `Pristine lands with carved mountains and curiously overgrown flora. In place of the horizon of typical worlds, naturally, the lands gradually rise into a faded silhouette showing off the inspiring scale of the structure.`
	description `The creators of the ring seemed to have put great importance on the pristine scenery, great bodies of water bordered by rocky cliffsides and tall plateaus. It's an idyllic place to be.`
	description `Unlike Quarg ringworlds, circadian shaders are employed to provide a steady circadian rhythm for the surface. A close flyover of the shaders will reveal that they bear massive arrays of solar panels inwards towards the star. The days here are noticeably longer than any typical planet, undeniably by design.`

	attributes "requires: quantum keystone" "requires: resonant drain"
	landscape "landscape/the irm/snowcap"
	description `The snow-capped peaks along the equator offer some of the most suitable lodgings. Ruins of ancient infrastructure lie in overgrowth, and the lands have shifted and collapsed much of the foundations.`
	description `Remarkably on a flyover of the land there are no signs of fauna, big or small. The oceans are teeming with creatures who move in large pods, some creatures that are only partially submerged lay on the water surface, large enough to be mistaken as small land masses.`
planet "Slic Airn"
	government "Uninhabited"
	landscape "land/station11"
	description `As you drew nearer to dock, the station's outlines became sharper against the backdrop of stars, its' undoubtably once gleaming surfaces are now faded and weathered by the harshness of space. Mechanical clamps secure your vessel to the desolate outpost, a link between the present and a forgotten past lie in the stations perservering operation.`
	description `The air in the port and throughout the station is unexpectedly heavy, with no clear distinction from any planet with a particularly heavy atmosphere. You imagine that past each door or around each corner you might find some sign of decay or indication of abandon, but all interior surfaces are in as good condition as a newly opened station. The walls are slightly warm to the touch, in contrast to the quiet of the presumably idle station.`
